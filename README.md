# Code Formatter

Todo:
 - Take all training data and split up by lines
 - Tag lines with each classification
 - Train model with lines
 - Take training text and attempt to classify individual lines
 - Note classification error
 - Assuming error is related to context, build out context-aware training logic
 - Assuming things like comments in code and misc output are hard, write logic to handle those cases
 - Set up training data and model to build into binary
 - Set up better test cases and find and address formatting misses
 - Maybe come up with a better name as this formats nothing and does not mutate code (auto-pre, autocode, autocodeblock)
